# Ionic 4 & Angular 6 Boilerplate

This repo intends to provide a Ionic 4 & Angular 6 Boilerplate.

# Disclaimer 

Please note that the current repo is a WIP ( work in progress ) and that it won't be functionnal before a while as Ionic 4 is still in beta and Angular 6 in early release. 

If you intend to use a fully functional boilerplate, maybe you should consider sticking for now to earlier versions. Otherwise, this readme will be updated once the whole process of integration done. 

Process will be the following : 

1. Build a functionnal basis of a working ionic 4 & Angular 6 blank application
2. Rebase [Ionic 3 & Angular 5]() code refactoring parts that breaks due to major changes
3. Rebuild the environmental & documentation configurations

Feel free to contribute
